This is my capstone project for my undergraduate university. 
There are three main files:

- Baxter et al: This is a replication of the Baxter et al 1991 paper in which I rerproduce their discrete cellular automata model adn conduct more analysis.
- LGA-FHP: This is my implementation of the lattice gas cellular autommata model.
- FHP-Modified: This is my modification to the LGA model so it can be more suitable for simulating granular materials.
